A Simple Calculator program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program typically takes two numbers as input from the user and then applies the selected operation to those numbers.

How the Program Works:

Define Functions for Operations:

Four functions are defined: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide(). Each function takes two arguments (x and y) and returns the result of the corresponding operation.
1. Addition: x + y
2. Subtraction: x - y
3. Multiplication: x * y
4. Division: x / y, but it checks if y is not zero (to prevent a division by zero error).

Display Operations to User:

The program displays a list of possible operations (1 for Add, 2 for Subtract, 3 for Multiply, 4 for Divide) to the user and prompts them to choose one by entering a number between 1 and 4.

Input Numbers:

The program asks the user to input two numbers. These numbers are taken as float (to handle decimal numbers as well as integers).

Perform Operation:

Based on the userâ€™s choice (from the earlier menu), the program calls the corresponding function.
It then displays the result of the chosen operation applied to the input numbers.

Handle Invalid Input:

If the user enters a choice that is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, the program will display "Invalid input."

Division by Zero Handling:

For division, the program checks if the second number (y) is zero. If it is, the division operation is not performed, and it displays a message: "Cannot divide by zero".
